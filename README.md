# Image Captioning Model Overview


Image Captioning is the process of generating a textual description for given images. It has been
a very important and fundamental task in the Deep Learning domain. Image captioning has a
huge amount of application. NVIDIA is using image captioning technologies to create an
application to help people who have low or no eyesight.
Several approaches have been made to solve the task. One of the most notable work has been put
forward by Andrej Karpathy, Director of AI, Tesla in his Ph.D. at Stanford. In this article, we
will be talking about the most used and well-known approaches proposed as a solution to this
problem. We will also be looking at a python demo example on the Flickr Dataset in Python.
